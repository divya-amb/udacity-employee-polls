# Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

This is the code for the "Employee Polls" Project for Udacity's React Nanodegree. In this app, an employee can create polls for coworkers. The process goes like this: An employee is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.

Users will also be able to answer polls, see which polls they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post polls, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

Run npm install before running `npm start` or `npm test`

## How To

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The login credentials can be obtained from the _DATA.js file within the data folder. The app will require login again if the URL is updated manually.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
